# Directive Control — Login Warning Banner

---

## What Is a Directive Control?

Guides/instructs users toward **compliant behavior**. Goal is **compliance** — awareness, consent, and behavioral guidance.

---

## Objective

Display a legal notice / acceptable use policy at login.

---

## Technique

Set registry keys via PowerShell.

---

## Step-by-Step

**Step 1 — Open PowerShell as Admin (as Jaime):**
```
Right-click PowerShell → Run as Administrator
```

---

**Step 2 — Set the banner text:**
```powershell
$BannerText = "This computer system is the property of Structureality Inc. Unauthorized access is prohibited. All activity is monitored."
```
What it does: Stores the warning message in a variable.

---

**Step 3 — Set the banner caption (title):**
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" -Name "LegalNoticeCaption" -Value "WARNING" -Force
```
What it does: Sets the title of the login banner popup.
When to do this: When you want users to see a warning title before logging in.

---

**Step 4 — Set the banner message (body):**
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" -Name "LegalNoticeText" -Value $BannerText -Force
```
What it does: Sets the full warning message displayed at login.
When to do this: When you need legal notice, acceptable use policy, or consent acknowledgment.

---

**Step 5 — Test it:**

```
This confirms the directive control is working.

## Key Lesson
